# Python task for the QA Team

According to the requirement, the Python script [QA_test.py](https://github.com/bbrandea/python_taskBB/blob/main/QA_test.py) synchronizes two folders (one-way), source and
replica, and maintains a full, identical copy of source folder at replica folder. 
The operations applied to the files are logged and printed.
The script has been initially designed to run automatically every 24 hours, but I have also included the suggestion of running before business hours (Monday to Friday at 8:00).

An example of log file history is listed in [Sync_history.txt](https://github.com/bbrandea/python_taskBB/blob/main/Sync_history.txt), where experiments duirng the script creation have been recorded.
The final lines of this file display the expected behaviour of the script.
For privacy reasons, the paths mentioned in the script and log file are fictional.

Enjoy! üê∞
